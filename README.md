# Quantization
## This project trains and evaluates a deep learning image classification model, then converts and quantizes it using ONNX for mobile deployment. An Android Studio app integrates the quantized model, enabling real-time video and gallery-based image classification.

## **Example Usage:**
### Model Training and Evaluation:
```bash
python3 -m main --config_path 'python_dev/default_config.json'
```
You can find all training parameters as well as data path in *python_dev/default_config.json*.

### Model quantization:
```bash
python3 -m model_quantization --config_path 'python_dev/default_config.json'
```
This script will save quantized (to INT8) .onnx model. Outputs are dequantized to FLOAT32, but you can remove dequantized layer in *python_dev/vgg_13.py* to store outputs in INT8 format.

### Start an adroid application:
You need to install Android Studio and —Åorresponding SDKs. Then run *android* folder as project in android srudio, build it and run. You should connect your mobile phone to your PC/laptop. 
Android device should be in [developer mode](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) with USB debugging enabled.

You also need to copy .onnx model file to *android/app/src/main/res/raw*
